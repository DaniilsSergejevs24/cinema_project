# 🎬 **Project Overview**

The project is a Cinema Booking Application designed to offer a smooth and user-friendly platform for moviegoers to explore available films, read about them, and book their seats with ease. The system is designed with two types of users in mind: regular users and administrators. Each user type has a set of dedicated features tailored to their needs and permissions.

# **Core Features**

**1. Movie Browsing**

Users can view a list of currently available movies.

Each movie has:

·      A title

·      Poster

·      Genre

·      Description or synopsis

·      Showtimes

·      Rating

**2. Seat Booking System**

Users can:

·      Choose a movie and showtime

·      View the seating layout

·      Select available seats

·      Confirm and pay for their bookings

·      Seats once booked are locked for other users, preventing double-booking.

**3. User Account System**

Users can:

·      Register and create an account

·      Login/logout securely

·      Upload a profile picture

·      Change/update their password

·      View their booking history

**4. Admin Dashboard**

Admins have extended capabilities, including:

·      Add/edit/delete movies

·      Manage showtimes

·      Monitor seat bookings

·      Manage users (view, block/unblock)

·      Upload movie posters and trailers

·      View application statistics and user activity

**5. Authentication and Security**

Passwords are stored **securely** using hashing.

Sessions or tokens are used to maintain user login status.

Basic security validations in place to prevent unauthorized actions.

**6. User Interface & Experience**

Clean, responsive design for easy use on mobile and desktop.

Real-time updates on seat availability.

Clear navigation between pages (home, movie details, account, etc.)
